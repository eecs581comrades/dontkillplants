                <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">When deciding what plant is right for you, there are several factors to keep in mind.</h3>
                <p>The most important part is where you are located in the world - your availability of plants will heavily depend on what plants are native to your region. We encourage you to primarily focus on growing native plants, as they have a better likelihood of surviving.</p>
                <p>In the United States, Canada, Denmark, and France, the United States Department of Agriculture has a <a>native plants database</a> that may prove useful to outdoor planting. Just input your location!</p>
                <p>However, if you're just looking for houseplants, read on.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Dry Areas</h3>
                <p>Dry areas require drought-resistant plants, such as Rosemary, Sage and California Lilac. A partial list can be found from the <a href="https://www.calwater.com/conservation/low-water-drought-resistant-plants/">California Water Service.</a> When buying drought-resistant plants, remember not to water them too often - they were meant to go weeks on end without water.</p>

                <p>Cold areas require temperature-resistant plants, such as Lily-of-the-Valley, Coneflower, and Holly. A partial list can be found from <a href="https://shoalcreeknursery.com/blog/80727/all-weather-plant-types-plants-that-will-survive-cold-weather">Shoal Creek Nursery.</a> Remember to keep cold-resistant plants at a cooler temperature while still providing lots of sun.</p>
